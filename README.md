# AspNetCoreTypeScript
A sample project on how to include typescript within AspNet Core 2.1.

## Other cool stuff I've setup on this project

* Bundle config to group and minify static files (e.g: css and js);
* __BuildBundlerMinifier__ nuget package to provide bundle files during the build process;
* Library manager (__libman.json__) to manage some lib packages I've used (like jquery and bootstrap css);
* Still about the Library Manager, I've used the __Microsoft.Web.LibraryManager.Build__ in order to allow __libman.json__ restore lib files during the build process.
